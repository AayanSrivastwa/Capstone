# Fashionista – Simple E-Commerce Website (HTML + CSS)

This is my capstone project made using only **HTML5 and CSS3**.  
The theme I selected is an **E-Commerce Fashion Store**.  
The website is designed mainly for **laptop screens**, but it also works on tablets and mobile phones using simple responsive CSS.
